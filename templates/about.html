            Hi! I'm Taemin Park. I'm currently a student at <a href="https://www.wroclaw-international-school.pl/">Wroclaw International School</a>. I was born in 2011 in Seoul (South Korea), and when I was 5, our family immigrated to Milan (Italy). We lived there for four years before returning to Korea, where we stayed until we finally moved to Poland when I was 13 years old.

            My programming journey began in 2024 when I took the first course of <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2025/">CS50x</a>, which I successfully completed in 2025. Since then, I’ve been deepening my understanding of computer science and building a strong foundation in Machine Learning through <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning">Andrew Ng’s Machine Learning Specialization</a>. I’m also experimenting with small coding projects and participating in hackathons.

            Outside of programming, I enjoy a mix of strategy and sports. I love playing chess-both online and in school competitions—and I’m passionate about football, whether I’m playing with friends or watching matches. My favorite movie is <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1024648/">F1: The Movie</a>, and I enjoyed the thrill and strategy behind Formula 1 racing. One of my favorite books is <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2767052-the-hunger-games">The Hunger Games</a>, which I admire for its exciting plot and strong characters. I also follow <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/RyanTrahan">Ryan Trahan</a> on YouTube—his 50 States series is one of the most entertaining things I’ve ever watched!

           As an ESTJ, I’m someone who enjoys structure, planning, and leading projects with a clear purpose. My favorite subject is math, and I love solving problems and learning new concepts that help me better understand the world around me. I’m always looking for ways to grow and challenge myself—whether that’s by studying, competing, or simply trying something new.
