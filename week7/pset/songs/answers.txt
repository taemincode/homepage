If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?
I could write the following SQL query:
    SELECT AVG(energy) AS average_energy,
    AVG(valence) AS average_valence,
    AVG(danceability) AS average_danceability
    FROM songs;

Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?
There might be cases where a listener had only listened to 100 songs in 2018, whether they liked them or not. For example, they might not have enjoyed the songs ranked after the top 50.
As a solution, we could calculate the average energy, valence, and danceability using only the top 20 songs. However the rankings should represented in songs.db.
I could then write the following SQL query:
    SELECT AVG(energy) AS average_energy,
    AVG(valence) AS average_valence,
    AVG(danceability) AS average_danceability
    FROM songs
    WHERE rank <= 20;
